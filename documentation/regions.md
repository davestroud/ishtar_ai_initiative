# War-Torn Regions: Country Statistics

This document provides a summary of the war-torn statistics for the following countries:

## Afghanistan

- **Conflict Overview**: Afghanistan's conflict history spans over four decades, beginning with the Soviet invasion in 1979, followed by civil unrest, the emergence of the Taliban in the 1990s, the US-led invasion in 2001, and the eventual return to Taliban control in 2021. The conflict has involved various factions including the Afghan government, the Taliban, US and NATO allies, and numerous insurgent groups, driven by ideological, ethnic, and geopolitical complexities.

- **Displacement**: The enduring conflict has led to significant displacement, creating one of the world's largest populations of refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). The UNHCR reports approximately 2.6 million Afghan refugees globally, alongside millions more displaced within Afghanistan itself due to ongoing hostilities and insecurity.

- **Casualties**: Afghanistan has witnessed extensive human suffering, with tens of thousands of civilians killed and countless more injured. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) has documented tens of thousands of civilian casualties since it began its systematic records in 2009, highlighting the conflict's devastating impact on the Afghan population.

- **Infrastructure Damage**: The conflict has extensively damaged Afghanistan's infrastructure, impacting homes, educational institutions, healthcare facilities, and critical public services. This destruction impedes access to essential healthcare and education, further exacerbating the challenges faced by the Afghan people.

- **Humanitarian Aid Needs**: Afghanistan's humanitarian crisis is acute, with widespread food insecurity, lack of clean water, and healthcare access, compounded by the need for basic shelter and essentials. The situation has deteriorated with the COVID-19 pandemic and recent political upheavals, escalating the demand for immediate international humanitarian intervention.

- **Recovery and Reconstruction Efforts**: International organizations, NGOs, and government initiatives have been involved in Afghanistan's recovery and reconstruction efforts, focusing on infrastructure rebuilding, service restoration, economic recovery, and support for displaced populations' return and reintegration. Nonetheless, the efforts are hampered by ongoing political instability, security challenges, and limited financial resources, slowing the country's reconstruction and recovery progress.

### Iraq

- **Conflict Overview**: Iraq has faced decades of conflict, starting with the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, the Gulf War in the early 1990s, the 2003 US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, and the subsequent insurgency, leading to the rise of the Islamic State (IS) group in 2014. These conflicts have involved a multitude of actors, including Iraqi government forces, US and coalition forces, various insurgent groups, and IS fighters, with the underlying causes ranging from sectarian tensions to geopolitical interests.

- **Displacement**: The cumulative impact of these conflicts has led to significant displacement within Iraq. At the height of the IS crisis, millions were displaced. Although many have returned home, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) reports that there are still hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Iraq, along with Iraqi refugees in neighboring countries.

- **Casualties**: The human toll in Iraq has been enormous, with hundreds of thousands of deaths, including civilians, security forces, and combatants across the different phases of conflict. The violence associated with IS alone resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and injuries, according to the United Nations and various human rights organizations.

- **Infrastructure Damage**: Iraq's infrastructure has suffered extensively due to the conflicts, with significant destruction to homes, schools, hospitals, and critical utilities. The battle against IS, particularly in cities like Mosul, resulted in widespread devastation, rendering large areas uninhabitable and disrupting basic services.

- **Humanitarian Aid Needs**: The needs in Iraq remain substantial, with ongoing requirements for food assistance, medical care, shelter, and support for returning populations. The conflict with IS exacerbated pre-existing vulnerabilities, and despite the end of major combat operations, many communities continue to face challenges in accessing basic necessities.

- **Recovery and Reconstruction Efforts**: Post-IS, Iraq has embarked on extensive recovery and reconstruction efforts, with international support from entities like the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and various countries. These efforts focus on rebuilding infrastructure, restoring public services, and supporting economic recovery and social cohesion. However, the scale of destruction and the complexity of Iraq's sectarian and political landscape pose significant challenges to full recovery.
