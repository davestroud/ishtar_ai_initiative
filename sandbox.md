# Ishtar AI analyzes reports, social media, and satellite imagery for humanitarian aid optimization and logistics planning. This involves integrating various AI and Machine Learning (ML) models, including but not limited to LLMs, for text analysis and Computer Vision (CV) models for satellite imagery interpretation.

## 1. Project Scope Definition

- **Objective**: Ishtar AI is an AI-driven system that utilizes LLMs and CV models to identify regions in need of humanitarian aid and optimize aid delivery logistics.
- **Deliverables**: An app that processes textual data and satellite imagery to generate actionable insights for humanitarian aid distribution and logistics optimization.
- **Stakeholders**: Humanitarian organizations, logistics teams, local governments, and affected populations.

### 2. Data Collection and Processing

- **Textual Data Sources**: Reports are collected from NGOs, news articles, social media posts, and other relevant digital platforms. Web scraping tools and APIs where available.
- **Satellite Imagery Sources**: Imagery is obtained from satellite providers and relevant organizations offering open-access data (e.g., NASA, ESA).
- **Data Processing**:
  - Textual Data: Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are used to clean and preprocess the data, including tokenization, removing stop words, and lemmatization.
  - Satellite Imagery: Images are preprocessed by adjusting resolution, normalizing brightness and contrast, and segmenting areas of interest.

### 3. Model Development

- **LLM for Textual Analysis**:
  - LLM's are trained or fine-tuned on the collected textual data to identify signals indicating the need for humanitarian aid. This includes learning from reports of damage, displacement, and requests for assistance.
  - Models are developed to understand and prioritize needs based on severity, urgency, and the number of people affected.
- **CV Model for Satellite Imagery Analysis**:
  - Transformer-based models are trained on satellite images to identify areas of destruction, displacement camps, and possible routes for aid delivery.
  - Object detection is used to identify roads, bridges, and damaged infrastructure.
- **Integration**: A system where outputs from both the LLM and CV models are integrated to give a comprehensive overview of needs and logistics planning.

### 4. Optimization and Routing

- **Routing Algorithm**: Implement algorithms such as Dijkstra's or A* for optimal route planning, considering constraints like road blockages and infrastructure damage identified by the CV model.
- **Resource Allocation Model**: Develop a model to optimize the distribution of resources based on needs identified by the LLM, accounting for factors like population density, urgency, and accessible routes.

### 5. Deployment and Monitoring

- **Platform**: A user-friendly app where stakeholders can input data, receive updates, and visualize aid distribution plans and routes has been built.
- **Continuous Learning**: A feedback loop is set up where the system can learn from new data and outcomes of aid distributions to improve future predictions and recommendations.
- **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Implement tools for monitoring the system's performance and impact, including real-time tracking of aid delivery and post-distribution assessments.

### 6. Ethical Considerations and Data Privacy

- Ensure compliance with data protection laws and ethical guidelines, especially concerning sensitive information and the use of satellite imagery.
- Implement robust data anonymization and encryption methods to protect the identities and locations of individuals in conflict zones.

### 7. Collaboration and Stakeholder Engagement

- This project works closely with humanitarian organizations, local authorities, and communities to validate needs assessments and optimize aid delivery strategies.
- Engagement with technology partners and data providers to ensure access to relevant data and tools is an ongoing process.

### Technical Stack

- **AI and Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers.
- **Data Processing and Analysis**: Python (Pandas, NumPy), Apache Spark.
- **Web Scraping and APIs**: Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, Twint for Twitter data.
- **GIS and Mapping**: QGIS, ArcGIS, Google Earth Engine for satellite data analysis and mapping.
- **Development and Deployment**: Docker for containerization, AWS for hosting and storage, Gradio for application development.

This project structure combines state-of-the-art AI technologies with practical strategies for implementation, ensuring the system is capable of addressing the critical needs of humanitarian aid distribution and logistics planning in conflict-affected regions.
